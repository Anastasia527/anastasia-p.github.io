          <p>
            Hi there! I’m Anastasia, an aspiring product and UX designer.
            Fuelled by curiosity and creativity and lots of caffeine. I take
            pride in designing and creating for the best possible user
            experiences. Whether it’s crafting intuitive interfaces, solving
            complex design problems, or enhancing digital interactions, I thrive
            on turning ideas into meaningful and user-friendly solutions. With a
            keen eye for detail and a passion for human-centered design, I
            strive to create products that are not only visually appealing but
            also functional and accessible. Let’s build something great
            together!
          </p>

            <h3>Use heading elements in the proper hierarchial order</h3>
            <p>
              The purpose of HTML is to describe the structure and the content
              of the webpage and nothing else. Good HTML is written clearly,
              cleanly, consistently, and with a good structure. Valid HTML
              follows the conventions practices established by HTML 5 resources
              and ensures that nothing strange, broken or unexcpected will
              happen when CSS, Javascript and other code is applied to the
              structre and content of page.

            <h3>Don't use HTML to for Styling</h3>
            <p>
              Styling instructions that set the amount of space above and below
              an element of text should be handled by CSS. Using the <br />
              tag to create extra space breaks and separation of markup and
              styling and will make the website behave unpredictably.

            <h3>Use the alt attribute to describe images for screen readers</h3>
            <p>
              An accessible web is an inclusive one. People with visual
              impairments can’t see images, nor can search engines. Be sure to
              use the alt attribute with every img element and include an
              accurate description of the content of any image.
            </p>

            <div>
              This will also help you debug your code if the image fails to
              load.

            <p>
              Anything that needs to be read, loaded and understood by the
              browser but not shown to the user should be enclosed in the head
              tag. This will include the page title, character set, meta
              information about how the page should load, and links to any
              linked files like stylesheets.
